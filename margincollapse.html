    <p class="p1">This is the first paragraph.</p>
    <p class="p2">This is the second paragraph.</p>
    <p>Here we have two paragraphs, the first one has 70px bottom margin, So we have 70px margin from bottom here, and the  second one has 70px top margin, we have 70px margin from top here too. So between the first and second paragraphs we have 140px margin but when we see the result, we only have 70px margin. This happen call Margin collapse.</p>
